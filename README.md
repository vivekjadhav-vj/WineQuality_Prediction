## Problem Statement:
To build a methodology to Prediction for Wine Quality.

In this project, I am building a methodology for
Prediction for Wine Quality.
 In this project, I am using KNN, Decision tree,
RandomForestClassifier, XGBClassifier algorithms.
 I have deployed the model Hiroku on the
cloud platform.


## Deployment:

We will be deploying the model to the Heroku Cloud platform. 

Deployment Link: https://wine-quality-prediction-vj.herokuapp.com/



## Result:

#Predict value  ≤  3  →→    Result = 'Bad'

#Predict value = 4    →→   Result = 'Below Average'

#Predict value  =  5  →→   Result = 'Average'

#Predict value =  6   →→   Result = 'Good'

#Predict value  =  7  →→   Result = ‘'Very Good'

#Predict value ≥  8  →→   Result = 'Excellent'
