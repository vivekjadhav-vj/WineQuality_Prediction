Deployment Link: https://wine-quality-prediction-vj.herokuapp.com/



## Result:

#Predict value  ≤  3  →→    Result = 'Bad'

#Predict value = 4    →→   Result = 'Below Average'

#Predict value  =  5  →→   Result = 'Average'

#Predict value =  6   →→   Result = 'Good'

#Predict value  =  7  →→   Result = ‘'Very Good'

#Predict value ≥  8  →→   Result = 'Excellent'
